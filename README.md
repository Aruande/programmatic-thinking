# Intro to Programmatic Thinking

Welcome to this introductory course on programmatic thinking.

The course work will be split into levels, each of which is represented by a brach, each of which will try to reinforce one of the x pillars of programmatic thinking:



### Programmatic Thinking

- Start with the result and work backwards
- Use pseudo code to make big problems into small problems
- Abstraction through substitution

### Data Structures

* Objects are ways to group variables by **name**
* Arrays are ways to group variables **without** names

### Iteration

* Running an unspecified number of times

### Rendering

* HTML & CSS are tools to describe what a user sees

### React

* Putting it all together
